		<h1>Sim data</h1>
		<p id="output">Getting data from sim...</p>
		<h1>Explanation</h1>
		<p>This page demonstrates that the HTTP API as of X-Plane 12.1.1 allows every website to access a currently running Sim. Usually browsers prevent such access for security reasons but X-Plane responds with a "*" CORS header value thus permitting requests from websites.</p>
		<p>While having access from websites is a very nice feature (providing sim extensions has never been that simple - just distribute a link!), there needs to be some form of authorization. I think a simple site on "api/v1/authenticate" which uses the "Origin" value sent by the client should be enough. The user would have to confirm "Allow {Origin} to access X-Plane?" and requests from that website would now have Origin returned in the CORS header instead of the insecure "*".</p>
